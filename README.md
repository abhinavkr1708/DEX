# Decentralized Exchange (DEX) 
Decentralized exchange making use of Automated Market Maker (AMM) like Uniswap V1. This project creates a new token named [ForbiddenGOLD(FBG)](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/token/0x183e70162282704dae349605f979385076608440), creates a contract that allows user to add/remove liquidity from the token, swap the token for eth and vice-versa.
The contract can be accessed [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x15c6fb01def0c5f4264d18534f78810582734526#code). 
The token can be viewed [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x183e70162282704dae349605f979385076608440).

## More Details

The contracts have been deployed on Sepolia Testnet of Ethereum. This is a backend project that has been created using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and is available in the [hardhat](https://github.com/Tanmay-Bhatnagar-03/DEX/tree/main/hardhat) directory. Smart contracts for the project are available in [hardhat/contracts](https://github.com/Tanmay-Bhatnagar-03/DEX/tree/main/hardhat/contracts) directory and it is written in [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/). The deployment script for the smart contract is written in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript). <br />

The contract has been `verified and published` on [Sepolia Blockchain Explorer](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/). Connect your wallet to the explorer and read/write on the contract.<br />

The exchange works on the [Automated Market Maker (AMM)](https://chain.link/education-hub/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm#:~:text=Automated%20market%20makers%20(AMMs)%20are%20a%20type%20of%20decentralized%20exchange,trade%20directly%20through%20the%20AMM.) Model, the same principal on which [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) operates.
